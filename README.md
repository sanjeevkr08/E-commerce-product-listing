Challenges Faced:- 

During the development process, I encountered several challenges, including:

Dynamic Data Handling: Implementing dynamic updates for the product listing required a good understanding of JavaScript event handling. I overcame this by researching best practices and using JavaScript's Array. filter() method to manage filtering effectively.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the website looked good on all devices required extensive testing and adjustments using media queries. I learned to use CSS Flexbox and Grid to achieve a responsive layout.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the creation of an eCommerce product listing website, highlighting my ability to work with dynamic web technologies. I learned valuable skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and experience in organizing and managing project files effectively.
